Experimental project using Electron, React and imghash.

The intention was to develop a free tool that can be used to scan photos for duplicates.
The user can then, via a configuration, determine which photos of the duplicates they would like to keep and what to do with the remainders.

The package step is currently broken so it can't be delivered and used as an EXE just yet, so it can only be tested currently by doing the following steps:

1. clone repo
2. install dependencies with yarn
3. yarn start
